# ⏱️ Time Complexity Java Examples

This repository provides simple, well-documented Java examples that demonstrate various **time complexities** (Big-O notation) in a clear and beginner-friendly manner.

## 📂 Structure

The examples are organized by type of time complexity:

| File                         | Time Complexity | Description                                |
|------------------------------|------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `ConstantTimeComplexity.java` | O(1) – Constant   | Accessing array by index, HashMap lookup   |
| `LinearTimeComplexity.java`   | O(n) – Linear     | Traversing array, finding the largest value |
| `QuadraticTimeComplexity.java`| O(n²) – Quadratic | Printing all possible pairs in an array    |
